This project is a simple photo application, allowing users to interact with the document in a number of ways through several different types of events.

## Events
- **click**: When the image descriptions are clicked on, they will reveal more information.
- **onclick**: (inline) When the "Toggle Italy Filter" button is clicked, non-Italy images' appearances will be toggled.
- **mousemove**: When the mouse is moved over the title, it is changed to a different title.
- **mouseout**: When the mouse is removed from the title, it is changed back.
- **select**: When some text is selected, it is enlarged.

## Technical Achievements

## Design Achievements
- **Materialize**: Used Materialize.css framework for design
- **Cards**: Used handy card implementation in Materialize to condense info about photos
- **Parallax**: Used parallax design for scrolling to increase visual appeal
